Though very primitive, I think LISP is a charming language and it was fun to learn. I do not think it was easier than Java, because I just found java more intuitive. Furthermore, the abundance of parenthesis in LISP can be hard to wrap my head around at times. Honestly, LISP is probably the most difficult language I personally used, only because of the parentheses. There are some parts of LISP that I do like, an example being the intuitive nature of parameters in functions. Simply putting the parameters directly after the function name is very straightforward compared to other languages I have used. My favorite application of this would be the IF function. In other languages I would have to write entire if else chains, but in lisp it's just two arguments: code to execute if its true and code to execute if its false. However, I don't see myself personally using LISP for the sole reason that I have found no easy ways to make API calls in LISP. In other languages it would just be a few lines of code. In LISP, it seems like I have to go through a bunch of hoops to make even the simplest API calls. Though I do see the purposes of LISP, as it would function better than other languages on low spec systems due to it being closer to machine language, and therefore easier for the computer to interpret and execute.
