# To execute the code file, open CLISP and type in the following command:

`(load "[file path of assignment.lsp]")`

When ran, the program will print all of the required test values given in the assignment.

Note: Please make sure your file path uses '/' instead of '\\', as to my understanding, CLISP can only recognize forward slashes.

# Also included in my submission is `wordle.lsp` because I would imagine that grading these is boring

`(load "[file path of wordle.lsp]")`

When ran, a LISP version of wordle I made while waiting for this assignment to publish will run. Instructions of the game are given in the program. Have fun!
